# Abstract

A great majority of rare diseases affecting millions of people worldwide have a genetic origin. 
Due to being highly heterogenous, complex, debilitating and often incurable, the diagnostic 
yield of rare diseases is extremely poor, therefore constituting a great healthcare burden. Most 
recently, a novel telomere-to-telomere human genome assembly, T2T-CHM13, has 
challenged the limitations of previous reference genomes â€“ GRCh38, presenting as the most 
extensive, accurate, and contiguous assembly of the human genome to date and, thus, 
promising striking enhancements for pathogenic rare disease variant discovery. In this thesis, 
we establish the GRCh38-comparable variant calling effectiveness of the T2T-CHM13 
reference, through stringent benchmarking studies. Additionally, we construct and refine a 
strategy for the analysis of short variant data and discovery of pathogenic causal rare disease 
variants using the T2T-CHM13 assembly. Later, we prove the clinical diagnostic potential of 
T2T-CHM13 by re-analysis and confirmation of rare variants in solved RD cases of African 
cohorts. With the intention of undertaking the diagnostic odyssey experienced by RD African 
patients, we tested the analysis of complex unresolved cases. Ultimately diagnostically 
ineffective, it outlined the technological and practice demands of employing a novel reference 
genome in diagnostic research.
